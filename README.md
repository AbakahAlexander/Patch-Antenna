# Patch-Antenna
A patch antenna is a directional antenna that is used for indoor locations covering single-floor offices, stores and small studios. 
It is mounted on a small, rectangular, flat surface and consists of two metallic plates placed upon each other.
In this project, I developed a simple patch antenna with a resonant frequency of 1.5GHz in ANSYS hfss.
The file for the project has been attached and can only be viewed with the software.
